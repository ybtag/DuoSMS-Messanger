This app is based on https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-SMS-Messenger, but its purpose it to enable people to share their messages between two Android devices. Each time a message is sent or recieved by either phone, a special message will be sent to the synced device which will tell it to add it to the list of messages on that device.
